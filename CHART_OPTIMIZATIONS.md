        this.lastFrameTime = performance.now();
        this.fpsHistory = [];
        this.memoryUsage = [];
    }
    
    updateFrame() {
        // Tracks FPS and memory usage
        // Provides performance warnings
        // Implements adaptive optimization
    }
}
```

### 2. Optimized Circular Arrays
```javascript
class OptimizedCircularArray extends Array {
    constructor(maxLength) {
        super();
        this.maxLength = Math.min(maxLength, MAX_BUFFER_SIZE);
        this._pool = []; // Object pool for reuse
    }
    
    push(element) {
        // Reuses objects from pool
        // Implements efficient cleanup
        // Manages memory automatically
    }
}
```

### 3. Intelligent Throttling
```javascript
class UpdateThrottler {
    constructor(delay = 33) { // ~30 FPS
        this.delay = delay;
        this.queue = [];
    }
    
    throttle(func, priority = 0) {
        // Priority-based queue management
        // Adaptive performance adjustment
        // Frame budget management
    }
}
```

### 4. GPU Acceleration
```css
.gpu-accelerated {
    transform: translateZ(0);
    backface-visibility: hidden;
    perspective: 1000;
}
